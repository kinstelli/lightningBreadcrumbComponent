First attempt at a more intuitive interactive Lightning component for breadcrumbing.

TODO:

* don't use all these aura:ifs, duh -- set classes as sequence or current pages change?
* ensure that this has a malleable centering class in various mobile contexts
* text can be too much in responsive version. allow responsible class to hide/show different title labels?
* verify that we don't want to inherit from various other ui types...??
